In this case, the O:C ratio is not available, so we conservatively assume a high ratio of 0.8. Using a simple published model, we estimate that 90% of the biochar C will remain in 568 years. This should be considered approximate, as permanence is only weakly correlated with composition, and likely depends on the storage environment and other factors.",1.0,,Feedstock for biochar is waste wood.,N/A,,,0.0,,Few details provided on project specifics.
