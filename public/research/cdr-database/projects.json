Sorbent feedstock is currently waste lime kiln dust, which will be disposed of after CO\u2082 capture. In future deployments, project may use limestone and cycle the sorbent through the carbonation process several times using calcination to release CO\u2082 between cycles. While the capacity of basic mineralization and calcination technologies are well established, achieving the accellerated rate of mineralization at scale is pending demonstration."

Project claims that the solution is well tested and understood at the 1 tCO\u2082/yr scale.
