      "methods": "The offered volume is 2585 net tCO\u2082 stored, reflecting life cycle and buffer deductions. Given the stated rate of 3.1 net tCO\u2082 stored per ton of biochar, this offer corresponds to the production of 833 t biochar. Given the stated C fraction of 92%, 833 t biochar corresponds to 2810 tCO\u2082 embodied in the biochar at the point of production. For consistency in reporting biochar projects, we report the volume of 90% of 2810, or 2528 tCO\u2082 permanently stored. \n\nTo validate permanence, we use a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010) (see [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/carbonplan/notebooks/tree/master/biochar) for details). The stated composition ratio of O:C of 0.021 corresponds approximately to a half life of 4969 years. Assuming a first order exponential decay with a half life of 4969 yields a decay constant of k = log(2) / 4969. 90% of the biochar volume will remain in 755 years via the equation -log(0.9)/k, so consistent with biochar projects, we express the permanence as 755 years. This should be considered approximate, as permanence is only weakly correlated with composition, and likely depends as much or more so on the decay environment (Campbell et al., 2019). Further analysis of the volume would require knowing the decay rate of the feedstock for comparison.\n\nFor consistency, the 90% correction on volume was extended to the calculation of negativity, specifically, applied to the 3.4 tCO\u2082 stored (relative to 0.17 tCO\u2082 emitted), and negativity was recomputed.\n",

The total volume estimates are then based on these rates projected over the project durations of 60 and 100 years for the two projects, respectively. The Rip\u2019s Redwoods appears to be a mix of Douglas Fir and Coastal Redwoods. Values in USFS yield tables for Douglas Fir in the Pacific Northwest are as high as 11.56 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr over a 20 year period (Smith et al., 2005), so the reported rate is very high but not implausible. A more accurate estimate would incorporate stand age, which was not provided, so as to better estimate current growth rates. The Guanare project appears to include mainly eucalyptus, which has published growth rates of 5.02 to 27.65 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr over an initial 3 years of growth (Ahimana & Maghembe, 1987), so the reported rate is again high but not implausible, but validation would require incorporating stand age.\n\nIn both cases, validation of volume estimates would benefit either from additional information on projects, or open sourcing some of the proprietary remote sensing based methods and datasets the project uses. While existing literature using remote sensing for estimating forest carbon stocks is established, and some of it is referenced, this is a complex topic that would benefit from more public data and reproducible methods.\n\nIn terms of permanence risk, we have not specifically analyzed fire risk for the Guanare project but it is stated by the project as high. Risk for Rip\u2019s Redwoods, given its ecoregion, is likely low to moderate (Anderegg et al., in publication), and we will soon provide more specific estimates of this risk, alongside risks related to drought and insects. Questions around permanece on the provided time horizon have more to do with socioeconomic risks such as default or bankruptcy.\n",

      "methods": "Reported volume is based on an assumption of 1.25 tCO\u2082 removed per 1 tCO\u2082 of olivine added to the ocean. If 160 t of olivine were procured, and assuming that ratio, a volume of 200 tCO\u2082 would be achieved.\n\nThe ratio of 1.25 is an upper bound on the realizable ratio. First, significant uncertainty remains around the timescale and extent of olivine cation dissociation in ocean environments, and many factors could reduce yield. Second, in general, for olivine weathering in ocean water, the ratio will depend on 1) the proportion of magnesium to iron in the olivine, 2) the equilibrium ratio of bicarbonates to carbonates in seawater, which itself depends on atmospheric pCO\u2082 and local alkalinity, and 3) the final state of the stored carbon. If the proportion of magnesium to iron is 1:0 then we calculate the molar mass of olivine of 140.7 g/mol (the molar mass of Mg\u2082SiO<sub>4</sub>). Only if all the ingassed CO\u2082 is stored as bicarbonate ions, 1 mole of olivine results in 4 moles of captured carbon, which yields a ratio of 4 \\* 44 g/mol CO\u2082 / 140.7 g/mol Mg-olivine = 1.25, the ratio provided in the proposal.\n\nHowever, using a more realistic ratio of magnesium to iron of 0.94:0.06 (Montserrat et al., 2017) gives a molar mass of olivine of 0.94 x 140.7 g/mol Mg-olivine + 0.06 \\* 203.8 g/mol Fe-olivine = 144.49 g/mol. And when using a more realistic bicarbonate to carbonate mole ratio, adding 1 mole of Mg adds between 1.4 and 1.7 moles of carbon (Section 2.3, Renforth & Henderson, 2017), giving a total ratio of about 3.1 x 44 g/mol CO\u2082 / 144.49 g/mol olivine = 0.944. In the limiting case where dissolution of olivine directly drives precipitation of carbonate minerals, the ratio could be as low as 2 x 44 g/mol CO\u2082 / 144.49 g/mol olivine = 0.61, but this limit is unlikely to be reached given precipitation timescales and alkalinity levels.\n\nFor the life cycle analysis, the lower ratio would also translate to a lower negativity, holding all other variables constant. A ratio of 0.944, for example, would yield a negativity of 1 - 0.049/0.944 = 0.948.\n\nThus, while plausible, the reported numbers reflect an upper bound, so we consider them with some uncertainty pending future experiments and data.\n",

The underlying component technologies are well established, and two papers are referenced that present theoretical analysis of the potential for combining them (Schmidt et al., 2019; Werner et al., 2018). We consider the volume validated as it is simply a function of the planned bio-oil procurement.

The reported volume of 50 tCO\u2082 / yr is based on a small pilot plant in Iceland commissioned in 2017. We used a back of the envelope calculation to evaluate the plausibility of this number. ClimeWorks claims they use amine sorbents. Assuming an adsorption capacity of 2 mmol CO\u2082 / g (Sanz-Pe\u0155ez et al., 2016), a range of 4-6 cycles per day, and a range of 200-500 kg or sorbent for the pilot plant, yields sequestration volumes of approximately 25-70t CO\u2082 / yr, making the estimate highly plausible.",

Nori provides on its project page the locations and NRTs (claimed sequestered volumes) associated with each plot. Nori specifies in its Croplands Methodology v1.1 a range of possible practices that farmers might adopt to increase soil carbon sequestration, including \u201cchanging or expanding crop rotations and cropping intensity, introducing cover crops and/or shifting from annuals to perennials, reducing tillage events and intensity and/or adopting new residue management techniques, adopting new irrigation management techniques, or substituting synthetic fertilizers with organic matter additions\u201d.\n\nBased on independent verification by Aster Global, Inc. provided on the Nori [project website](https://nori.com/verification/VmVyaWZpZXJKb2JSZXBvcnQ6NTcxMDk1NzAzNjY5OTY0OA==), this specific project is \"practicing no till and is using the regenerative agriculture practice of planting the crop directly into the living winter cover crop\". Even knowing these methods, sequestration rates are likely to be highly variable and challenging to quantify (Smith et al., 2019; Sanderman & Baldrock, 2010). Nori provides a range of 0.5 to 7.4 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr as plausible across a range of practices in its Croplands Methodology. Examples in the literature fall within that range, though are generally on the lower end, e.g. 1.17 \u00b1 0.29 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr for cover cropping (Poeplau & Don, 2011), 0.92 \u00b1 0.78 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr for several practices including conversion from conventional tillage to no tillage (Sanderman & Baldrock, 2010), and 1.43 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr for using no tillage (Sperow, 2015).\n\nTo contextualize the project within this range, we inspected a subset of four plots. While shape files were not directly available, we used a [web tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/area_finder.php) to approximately estimate four plot areas (Crewe II-1, Colchester 12, Ernies, Elder 1234), and then used the reported sequestration volumes to estimate rates of 6-11 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr. These would be rather high if meant to reflect 1 year, but Nori\u2019s methodology suggests that this may be a pilot project, in which the claims credits reflect multiple years of sequestration and far more clearly within a plausible range. Thus, we remain uncertain as to the claimed volumes.\n",

      "methods": "The reported volume is 62 tCO\u2082. Given the stated C fraction of 85%, this corresponds to a C volume of 16.89 tC. To validate volume and permanence, we use a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010) (see [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/carbonplan/notebooks/tree/master/biochar) for details). The stated composition ratio of O:C of 0.08 corresponds conservatively to a half life of 3734 years. Assuming a first order exponential decay with a half life of 3734 yields a decay constant of k = log(2) / 3734. 90% of the biochar volume will remain in 568 years via the equation -log(0.9)/k, so consistent with biochar projects, we express the permanence as 568 years, and the volume as 90% of 62, or 55.80 tCO\u2082. This should be considered approximate, as permanence is only weakly correlated with composition, and likely depends as much or more so on the decay environment (Campbell et al., 2019). Further analysis of the volume would require knowing the decay rate of the feedstock for comparison.\n\nWe were unable to extend the 90% correction on volume to the calculation of negativity, as the negativity was provided directly as a ratio, and while several components and emissions were listed, the relationship between the ratio and the components was not clear to us, so we could not re-express the ratio in terms of the underlying volumes.\n",

Based on public details from other deployments on the [project website](https://www.greensand.nl/nieuws), the expected carbon removed in 2020 from weathering for all GreenSand deposits deployed since 2007 totals 361 tCO\u2082, which comes from (2756 tCO\u2082 cumulatively removed by 2020) - (2395 tCO\u2082 cumulatively removed by 2019). It is not clear whether the claimed volume of 1000 tCO\u2082 reflects the carbon removal expected in one year based on 1) previous deployments that will remove the stated amount in 2020 due to ongoing weathering (which would be at odds with public website information), 2) based on a additional deployment, which would have to be large (potentially tens to hundreds of thousands of tons of olivine), or 3) an amount expected over some unspecified time horizon beyond one year. Further information would be required to validate the given estimate.\n\nIn general, the expected volume of carbon removal for olivine depends on the ratio of magnesium to iron, and whether weathering results in alkalization of runoff and/or formation of carbonate precipitates. The ratio of tCO\u2082 removed per t of olivine can range from 0.61 (assuming 94% magnesium and only precipitation of carbonate minerals) to 1.25 (assuming 100% magnesium and all dissolved bicarbonates) (Montserrat et al., 2017; Renforth & Henderson, 2017). The life cycle analysis references a ratio of 0.75 apparently in regards to this quantity, which falls within a plausible range. But again, without knowing the assumed time scale or the actual volume of olivine procured, we have difficulty validating the reported volume.\n",

While this estimate is based on 1 year, one could potentially extrapolate to a volume of 1680 tCO\u2082 for the 30 year duration of the problem. The low end estimate is based on COMET-Farms and the high end estimate is based on Eric Toensmeier's The Carbon Farming Solution. The low end volume would correspond to a carbon accrual rate of 11.42 tCO\u2082 / ha / year. As points of comparison from similar forest type groups, afforestation rates from USFS yield tables for live tree carbon stocks are 5.43 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr for Maple / Beech / Birch in the Northeast and 5.06 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr for Oak / Hickory in the Northeast (Smith et al., 2005) (annual rate based first 5 yr of growth). The provided volume number thus appears high if it only reflects above ground biomass. However, a range of farming practices are planned, including changes to grazing practices, and the claimed volume also likely includes soil carbon sequestration related to these changes in practice. COMET-Farms was used for these estimates, but we are unable to validate how it was used or parameterized. This uncertainty is further reflected in our uncertainty in the life cycle analysis and negativity, alongside questions around methane emissions from livestock.",

To validate volume and permanence, we use a simple decay model based on Campbell et al. (2019) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010) (see [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/carbonplan/notebooks/tree/master/biochar) for details). The stated composition ratio of O:C of 0.039 corresponds approximately to a half life of 4537 years. Assuming a first order exponential decay with a half life of 4537 yields a decay constant of k = log(2) / 4537 = 0.00006. 90% of the biochar volume will remain in 690 years via the equation -log(0.9)/k, so consistent with biochar projects, we express the permanence as 690 years, and the volume as 90% of 5000, or 4500.00 tCO\u2082. This should be considered approximate, as permanence is only weakly correlated with composition, and likely depends as much or more so on the decay environment (Campbell et al., 2019). Further analysis of the volume would require knowing the decay rate of the feedstock for comparison.\n\nFor consistency, the 90% correction on volume was extended to the calculation of negativity, specifically, applied to the 2.79 tCO\u2082 stored (relative to 0.046 tCO\u2082 emitted), and negativity was recomputed.\n",

For the above ground biomass portion, an initial point of comparisons includes published estimates in the US based on USFS yield tables, which range from 1.14 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr to 11.56 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr (Fargione et al., 2018, which is itself based directly on USFS yield tables for Ponderosa Pine and Douglas-fir). An additional point of comparison comes from yield tables for Sitka Spruce in the UK, which include reports of 10 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr to 26 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr (Magnani et al., 2007), depending on stand age, regional conditions, and productivity. Based on these comparisons, the above ground biomass component of volume reported by the project 18.3 - 25.7 tCO\u2082 / ha / yr is high, but not implausible. The rates for soil carbon and biochar are more difficult to validate without more specifics on planned practices, and the value for soil in particular appears high.

As such, this is an early stage technology, and lacking more specifics (or demonstration projects) makes it difficult to validate most metrics.

(2018) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010) (see [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/carbonplan/notebooks/tree/master/biochar) for details). The stated composition ratio of O:C of 0.05 corresponds approximately to a half life of 4313 years. Assuming a first order exponential decay with a half life of 4313 yields a decay constant of k = log(2) / 4313. 90% of the biochar volume will remain in 656 years via the equation -log(0.9)/k, so consistent with biochar projects, we express the permanence as 656 years. This should be considered approximate, as permanence is only weakly correlated with composition, and likely depends as much or more so on the decay environment (Campbell et al., 2018).\n\nWe also use the model presented by Campbell et al. (2018) to build intuition about the impact of the counterfactual feedstock carbon storage on the creditatable carbon storage achieved by biochar. Given the simple model of biochar decay presented above, a feedstock with a decay constant of 0.01 or greater will store <1% of the C stored in the biochar after 656 years. This project claims that feedstocks are primarily wood residues that would otherwise be combusted. Secondary feedstocks cited are walnut shells and wood residues that would otherwise be used to produce manufactured wood products like particleboard. We feel reasonably confident that the wood and agricultural residues used as a feedstock for this project have decay constants greater than 0.01 (Harmon et al., 2020), with the possible exception of manufactured wood products that end up in landfills (Ximenes et al., 2017).

Volume for this phase is plausible, contingent on sufficient biomass purchase. In the commercial phase, biomass will be purpose-grown over a 25,000 ha project area, and stored at a 195 ha burial site. Biomass will be harvested on a 2 year cycle. During this phase of the project, claimed removal is 400,000 tCO\u2082 / year. We infer a the project estimates a carbon removal rate of 16 tCO\u2082/ha/yr. Proposal specifies that all cultivated species will be woody, copiccing plants native to Australia. Specific species are not identified. Questions remain about coppicing, including variation between species in regrowth rates and how regrowth rates would affect operations and estimates of carbon removal. It is unclear what proportion of the claimed carbon removal is from aboveground or belowground biomass or how belowground biomass will be tracked across the 25 year project timeline."

The stated composition ratio of O:C of 0.021 corresponds approximately to a half life of 4969 years. Assuming a first order exponential decay with a half life of 4969 yields a decay constant of k = log(2) / 4969. 90% of the biochar volume will remain in 755 years via the equation -log(0.9)/k, so consistent with biochar projects, we express the permanence as 755 years.

Given the simple model of biochar decay presented above, a feedstock with a decay constant of 0.01 or greater will store <1% of the C stored in the biochar after 755 years.

LCA details are not available. Seller claims that 2.8 tCO\u2082 is embodied in each ton of biochar, corresponding to biochar that is at least 76% C by mass at point of production. Puro.earth materials indicate that each ton of biochar is credited for 3.091 tCO\u2082 / ton biochar. Reflecting the 2.5% buffer deduction, we infer that Puro is crediting Carbon Cycle biochar for 3.091 tCO\u2082/0.975 = 3.17 tCO\u2082, or biochar that is at least 86% C by mass. (The Puro crediting ratio should also reflect project emissions, so the actual credited %C is likely higher than 86%.) The offer of 800 tCO\u2082 thus corresponds to the production of up to 293 tons of biochar. We report volume as 90 percent of the carbon sequestered at point of production, or (800 tCO\u2082/ 0.975 * 0.9 = 738.5 tCO\u2082).

Accounting for the buffer, this corresponds to the production of about 811 t of biochar. For consistency with other biochar projects, gross volume of avoided emissions is decreased by 10% because permanence assumes the duration over which 90% of volume will remain. Further validation of volume would require comparison against likely decay rates of the feedstock, which we have not yet done."

Buffer is 16.62%, crediting period is 2008-2048, project area according to the 2020 ACR verification is ~115,000 acres planted with cottonwood and native hardwoods. Project claims an estimated total removal of 200 tCO\u2082/ac, for a basic removal rate of (200 tCO\u2082/ac * 2.471 ac/ha)/40yr = 12.4 tCO\u2082/ha/yr. USFS yield tables for Oak-hickory in the South Central region (0-30 yrs) indicate a growth rate of 6.92 tCO\u2082/ha/yr. Similarly, Elm-ash-cottonwood (South Central, 0-30 yrs) has a growth rate of 6.57 tCO\u2082/ha/yr. Project claims high density intercropping with removal of all cottonwood at 25 years. If both cottonwoods and hardwoods achieved \u201cnormal\u201d growth during these early years, removal rate could be estimated as 6.92 + 6.57 = 13.49 tCO\u2082/ha/yr. Project includes credits for increased soil carbon, with an ex ante assumption of 1.1876 tCO\u2082/ac/year for 20 years following tree planting.

Elm-ash-cottonwood (South Central, 0-30 yrs) has a growth rate of 6.57 tCO\u2082/ha/yr. Project claims high density intercropping with removal of all cottonwood at 25 years. If both cottonwoods and hardwoods achieved \u201cnormal\u201d growth during these early years, removal rate could be estimated as 6.92 + 6.57 = 13.49 tCO\u2082/ha/yr. Project includes credits for increased soil carbon, with an ex ante assumption of 1.1876 tCO\u2082/ac/year for 20 years following tree planting. [Credible concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-17/the-real-trees-delivering-fake-climate-progress-for-corporate-america) have been raised about the additionality of properties enrolled in this program.",

SOC is quantified using 15cm soil samples at each of the sampling sites. SOC data is extrapolated across the project area using an unproven method that relies on SOC correlation to satellite imagery data. Because of the sensitivity of measured SOC to sampling depth and the unproven nature of the extrapolation methods, we cannot validate this volume. In addition, there is inconsistency between the reporting of the two projects. Although they claim to pool sample data, there is no 2020 data reported for Wilmot, while Woodburn reports a major upswing in soil carbon stocks for 2020. If the reported data up until 2019 is considered, the net CO\u2082 stocks of the two projects together decreased by ~29,000 tCO\u2082e between 2017 and 2019."

          "comment": "The two well-documented Regen Network projects share a sampling regime and pool their soil data to calibrate quantification models. There are 6 sampling sites in Woodburn and 9 in Wilmot, for a total of 14 sampling sites over the combined 4409 ha project area. SOC is quantified using 15cm soil samples at each of the sampling sites. SOC data is extrapolated across the project area using an unproven method that relies on SOC correlation to satellite imagery data. Because of the sensitivity of measured SOC to sampling depth and the unproven nature of the extrapolation methods, we cannot validate this volume. In addition, there is inconsistency between the reporting of the two projects. Although they claim to pool sample data, there is no 2020 data reported for Wilmot, while Woodburn reports a major upswing in soil carbon stocks for 2020. If the reported data up until 2019 is considered, the net CO\u2082 stocks of the two projects together decreased by ~29,000 tCO\u2082e between 2017 and 2019."

In this case, the O:C ratio is not available, so we conservatively assume a high ratio of 0.8. Using a simple published model, we estimate that 90% of the biochar C will remain in 568 years. This should be considered approximate, as permanence is only weakly correlated with composition, and likely depends on the storage environment and other factors."
