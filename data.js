Project claims bio-oil purchased is in excess capacity from supplier, and that the source sawdust would have otherwise decomposed. From a narrow lifecycle perspective, the project avoids CO2 emissions because the source sawdust from which the bio-oil was procured would have decomposed, resulting in biogenic CO2 emissions. From a broad perspective, coupling biomass production, bio-oil production, and underground injection forms a carbon removal pathway. Geological sequestration capacity could become a constraint at larger scales.',
