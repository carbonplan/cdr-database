	source: 'Our database is sourced from public project proposals submitted to various entities, such as coroporate purchases of carbon removal. You can filter by these sources.',
	permanence: 'The duration over which carbon storage can be reasonably assured. For biological systems this duration is typically limited by physical and socioeconomic risks, whereas for chemical or geological systems the duration is effectively permanent.',
	volume: 'The total volume of carbon removal and/or avoided emissions achieved by the project. We interpret these as gross volumes. Net removal requires looking at negativity.',
	rating: 'After analyzing each metric separately, we combine them into a single score on a scale from 1 to 5. Validation of mechanism, volume, negativity, or permanence, or a perfect score on additionality, each add 1 to the total score.',
	mechanism: 'Does the project removal carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or does it avoid an emissions that would have otherwise occured. While both can have positive climate benefits, the difference matters for accounting purposes.',
