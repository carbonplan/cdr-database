# Feedback?

All our content is on Github, and we welcome feedback on all aspects of our work.

If you spot an issue with our website, design, or graphics, please open an [issue](https://github.com/carbonplan/reports) on Github.

If you identify a general issue with our metrics or our methods, please open an [issue](https://github.com/carbonplan/reports) on Github or send us an email at [feedback@carbonplan.org](mailto:feedback@carbonplan.org). We are committed to updating and improving our methods and metrics over time, and will gladly consider suggestions or engage with potential collaborators.

If you identify a specific issue with a project analysis or report, please open an [issue](https://github.com/carbonplan/reports) on Github or send us an email at [feedback@carbonplan.org](mailto:feedback@carbonplan.org). While we will listen to all feedback, our reports reflect an independent analysis by CarbonPlan, so we may not neccessarily make changes upon request, especially at the direct request of projects. That said, if you directly represent a project, and we are unable to make changes that adequately address your concern, we will consider posting a comment attributed to you alongside the report on your project.
