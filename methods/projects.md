# Projects

Here we provide notes for each of the projects we have analyzed, organized by project source. All analysis and evaluation is based on information provided in public project proposals, publications, and our own research. We do not exhaustively list methods for every metric for every project, but rather highlight specific considerations made or calculations performed. Methods are minimal if all information for that project is provided in the notes and comments in our reports.

Here and elsewhere, our primary focus is analyzing and independently validating scientific plausibility and credibility. Our hope is that sharing data and insights can benefit the field as a whole, and complement the work of the inventors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and activists who are making climate solutions a reality.

[Project-specific methods coming soon...]
