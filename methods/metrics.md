# Metrics

Most metrics are currently based directly on information provided by projects. We are actively developing methods for calibration based on independent data and models.

Marks next to metrics indicate either that we have confidence in the value (√), we are unable to confirm it (?), or we have reason to doubt it (x). We additionally annotate metrics with notes on basic project facts and comments explaining our current evaluation.

Metrics are only provided for … Not for cost. Sometimes we used an (!)

Our evaluation is primarily focused on whether claims are plausible and consistent with the best available science and data. We also strive, through our metrics, to harmonize concepts and quantities across a wide diversity of projects. This process is more straightforward for methods based on established physical or biological processes, and can pose challenges for proprietary industrial practices or inherently variable physical properties.

## Mechanism

We consider mechanism to be the basic process by which a project removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (indicated by the left ↓) and/or reduces carbon dioxide emissions (indicated by the right ↑). 

While we only consider projects that have the potential to be part of a carbon removal system, some of these projects are, in their current form, only responsible for avoided emissions. For example, utilization of CO2 for building materials where the CO2 is currently sourced from an industrial waste stream is avoided emissions, but would be carbon removal if sourced from direct air capture.

Some projects reflect early stage technologies. In these cases, we used a ? only to indicate that there is simply not enough information for confident validation.

## Volume

Volume is our best estimate of the current annual carbon removal and/or avoided emissions of the project. In most cases volume is based on the volume offered by a project to a particular funder or registry. We are working on calibrating these estimates with domain-specific data-driven approaches.

Note that a project with large volume but low negativity would not be an effective form of carbon removal or avoided emissions due to the large process emissions.

## Negativity

We define negativity as one minus the ratio of gross project emissions to gross carbon removal. If emissions are high relative to the amount of carbon removal, this value will approach 0.

Estimating negativity requires a life cycle assessment to quantify emissions sources. This can be an abstract 'per ton' estimate based on parameters of the technology, or derived from an instantiated project.

## Permanence

We consider the permanence of a project the duration over which durable storage can be reasonably assured. We apply heuristics to calibrate self-reported data.

When a range is provided, we report the minimum. For projects with contractual commitments (e.g. for soil and forest projects), we consider the contract duration the duration of permanence, even if it is lower than the number suggested by the underlying biogeophysics. And all times are reported relative to the most recent project documents.

Anything greater than 1000 noted as 1000.

For forests, we separately look at the physical and contractual risks. Wildfire etc., contractual etc.

## Cost

Project cost is taken directly from public project offerings. In most cases they are expressed in units of $/tCO2. In a subset of cases costs have been modified for accounting consistency across projects. Costs are expressed per volume, so while the price itself is entirely set by the project, any uncertainty associated with volume extends to the cost.

Barring unusual claims, we generally only specify whether costs are commensurate with recent literature reviews, in particular the National Academies report (CITE) and the WRI Carbon Shot report (CITE).

Inherently subjective, depends on the volume being accurate. We don’t attempt to validate it. Several volumes are uncertain.

## Additionality

Additionality refers to the causal relationship between the funds a climate project seeks and the climate benefits it claims. Establishing a connection depends on a counterfactual scenario that can’t be observed directly.

We examine projects for contextual information around the likelihood of additionality and rank them on a three point scale. Projects with high marginal costs or technologies without commercial markets score better than those where benefits have already been promised to other parties, or where non-climate co-benefits justify their economics.

## Transparency

The transparency score reflects the degree to which project information is publicly available. Which public materials would be useful depend on the project category, but can include: specific project parameters (locations, practices), specific technology components, peer-reviewed publications, and any datasets or models used for project quantification or life cycle assessment.
