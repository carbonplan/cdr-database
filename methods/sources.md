# Sources

We develop this database by analyzing public carbon dioxide removal project proposals. Some proposals also include a component of avoided emissions. Thus far, we have obtained proposals from public calls for carbon dioxide removal procurement, e.g. from corporations looking to purchase carbon removal. In principal we could obtain proposals from other sources (e.g. directly from projects), and we may explore this in the future.

In all cases, our analysis is based exclusively on public materials. In some cases we obtained early access to materials so as to make our reports as timely as possible, but we restricted our analysis to information that would eventually became public.

Here we provide a brief overview of our current primary sources.

## Microsoft 2021

In the fall of 2020 Microsoft announced a commitment to purchase carbon removal. They made a call for proposals, solicitied applications using [this form](), evaluated them, and selected winners for their 2021 purchase. All public materials are available as a [CSV file]().They received TK submissions. We only included TK (TK%) for our analysis, due to incomplete or missing data. The most common form of missing data included a specification of 0 tCOâ‚‚ volume, which makes the proposal invalid as a form of carbon removal from the perspective of our analysis.

## Stripe 2020

In the spring of 2020 Stripe announced a commitment to purchase carbon removal. They made a call for proposals, solicited applications using [this form](), evaluated them, and selected winners for their 2020 purchase. All public materials are available [on Github](). They received TK submissions. We included all TK (100%) for our analyses.
