If 160 t of olivine were procured, and assuming that ratio, a volume of 200 tCO\u2082 would be achieved.\n\nThe ratio of 1.25 is an upper bound on the realizable ratio. First, significant uncertainty remains around the timescale and extent of olivine cation dissociation in ocean environments, and many factors could reduce yield. Second, in general, for olivine weathering in ocean water, the ratio will depend on 1) the proportion of magnesium to iron in the olivine, 2) the equilibrium ratio of bicarbonates to carbonates in seawater, which itself depends on atmospheric pCO\u2082 and local alkalinity, and 3) the final state of the stored carbon. If the proportion of magnesium to iron is 1:0 then we calculate the molar mass of olivine of 140.7 g/mol (the molar mass of Mg\u2082SiO<sub>4</sub>). Only if all the ingassed CO\u2082 is stored as bicarbonate ions, 1 mole of olivine results in 4 moles of captured carbon, which yields a ratio of 4 \\* 44 g/mol CO\u2082 / 140.7 g/mol Mg-olivine = 1.25, the ratio provided in the proposal.\n\nHowever, using a more realistic ratio of magnesium to iron of 0.94:0.06 (Montserrat et al., 2017) gives a molar mass of olivine of 0.94 x 140.7 g/mol Mg-olivine + 0.06 \\* 203.8 g/mol Fe-olivine = 144.49 g/mol. And when using a more realistic bicarbonate to carbonate mole ratio, adding 1 mole of Mg adds between 1.4 and 1.7 moles of carbon (Section 2.3, Renforth & Henderson, 2017), giving a total ratio of about 3.1 x 44 g/mol CO\u2082 / 144.49 g/mol olivine = 0.944. In the limiting case where dissolution of olivine directly drives precipitation of carbonate minerals, the ratio could be as low as 2 x 44 g/mol CO\u2082 / 144.49 g/mol olivine = 0.61, but this limit is unlikely to be reached given precipitation timescales and alkalinity levels.\n\nFor the life cycle analysis, the lower ratio would also translate to a lower negativity, holding all other variables constant. A ratio of 0.944, for example, would yield a negativity of 1 - 0.049/0.944 = 0.948.\n\nThus, while plausible, the reported numbers reflect an upper bound, so we consider them with some uncertainty pending future experiments and data.\n"}, {"type": "Methods", "id": "STRP024", "applicant": "Charm Industrial", "content": "This project is a proposal to combine two existing components, fast pyrolysis for converting biomass to bio-oil, and underground waste injection of the bio-oil for permanent storage.
