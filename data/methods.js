(2018) and data reviewed in Spokas (2010) (see [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/carbonplan/notebooks/tree/master/biochar) for details). The stated composition ratio of O:C of 0.05 corresponds approximately to a half life of 4313 years. Assuming a first order exponential decay with a half life of 4313 yields a decay constant of k = log(2) / 4313. 90% of the biochar volume will remain in 656 years via the equation -log(0.9)/k, so consistent with biochar projects, we express the permanence as 656 years. This should be considered approximate, as permanence is only weakly correlated with composition, and likely depends as much or more so on the decay environment (Campbell et al., 2018).\n\nWe also use the model presented by Campbell et al. (2018) to build intuition about the impact of the counterfactual feedstock carbon storage on the creditatable carbon storage achieved by biochar. Given the simple model of biochar decay presented above, a feedstock with a decay constant of 0.01 or greater will store <1% of the C stored in the biochar after 656 years. This project claims that feedstocks are primarily wood residues that would otherwise be combusted. Secondary feedstocks cited are walnut shells and wood residues that would otherwise be used to produce manufactured wood products like particleboard. We feel reasonably confident that the wood and agricultural residues used as a feedstock for this project have decay constants greater than 0.01 (Harmon et al., 2020), with the possible exception of manufactured wood products that end up in landfills (Ximenes et al., 2017).

This project does not report an O:C ratio, so we conservatively assume a high ratio of 0.09, the highest claimed O:C ratio of the biochar projects currently appearing in this database, and estimate 90% permanence, using a simple decay model based on Campbell et al.

Project claims each modular unit can produce 4500 t biochar / year and sequester 16,750  tCO\u2082. However, 16,750 tCO2 *(12/44) = 4,568 tC, so the claimed ratio implies that the biochar produced is more than 100% C by mass, which is not possible.
