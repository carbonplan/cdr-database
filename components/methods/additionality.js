      ADDITIONALITY refers to the causal relationship between the funds a
      climate project seeks and the climate benefits it claims. Establishing a
      connection depends on a counterfactual scenario that canâ€™t be 
      observed directly.

      We examine projects for contextual information around the likelihood
      of additionality and rank them on a three point scale. 
      Projects with high marginal costs or technologies without commercial 
      markets score better than those where benefits have already 
      been promised to other parties, or where non-climate co-benefits 
      justify their economics.
