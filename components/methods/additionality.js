        Additionality refers to the causal relationship between the funds a climate project seeks
        and the climate benefits it claims. Establishing a connection depends on a counterfactual
        scenario that canâ€™t be observed directly.

        We examine projects for contextual information around the likelihood of additionality and
        rank them on a three point scale. Low values are not a concern if the goal is advancing
        technology, but should be a primary consideration if the goal is offsetting.
