      Metrics are based on information provided in public project offerings plus our own research. 
      We are actively developing methods for calibration
      based on independent data and models.

      Marks next to metrics indicate that we have either independently validated the claims
      (âˆš), we have reason to doubt the claims (x), or we are uncertain (?). A (?) should not
      be taken as a critism, rather a lack of information.
      We additionally include notes on projects and 
      comments explaining our evaluation.
