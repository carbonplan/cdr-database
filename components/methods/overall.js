      Most metrics are currently based directly on information provided by projects. 
      We are actively developing methods for calibration

      Marks next to metrics indicate either that have confidence in the value
      (âˆš), we are unable to confirm it (?), or we have reason to doubt it (x). 
      We additionally annotate metrics with notes on basic project facts and 
      comments explaining our current evaluation.
