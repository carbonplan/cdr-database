      Most metrics are currently based directly on information provided by projects, with our
      annotation. We are actively developing methods for calibration
      based on independent data and models.

    <Text>
      We annotate metrics with their provenance. For volume,
      negativity, and permanence a âˆš indicates our confidence in the metric
      and an x indicates we have questions. Abscence of a mark suggests that we
      need to do further work and/or require more information about the project.
