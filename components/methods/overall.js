      Most metrics are currently based directly on information provided by projects. 
      We are actively developing methods for calibration

      We annotate metrics with explanation and context. For volume,
      negativity, and permanence, a âˆš indicates our confidence in the metric
      and an x indicates we have questions. Absence of a mark suggests that we
      need to do further work and/or require more information,
      and should not be read as a critque.
